# SFML-Game
## Description

A Game, using C++ and SFML. I actually don't have any big ideas for this game.

## Requirements

You need the following tools to build this project:
* CMake
* Make 
* SFML (For Debian: `sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev`)

## Build instructions

You can build this project by using the *cmake* command.

First change the directory to the build folder:
```
cd build
```
Now run *cmake* on the /src folder:
```
cmake ../src
```
*cmake* creates a Makefile which we will run now:
```
make
```
To run the project, please type:
```
./Main
```

# SFML-Game
## Description
A Game, using C++ and SFML.
I have actualy no big ideas for this game.
## Build instructions
You can build this project by using the *cmake* command.

First create a new folder besides the cloned repository:
```
mkdir SFML-Game_Build
```
Change the directory to the created folder and run *cmake* in the original folder:
```
cd SFML-Game_Build
cmake ../SFML-Game_Build
```
*cmake* creates a Makefile which we will run now:
```
make
```
To run the project type:
```
./Main
```
